# This file provides some default configuration for the system
# Unless you have altered the hardware or really know what you're doing, changing this file is not recommended
# and can result in a malfunctioning system.
# Most of this configuration can be overriden by pedalboard specific configuration.  To accomplish that, add
# a file, named config.yml to the pedalboard directory (ie. /usr/local/modep/.pedalboards/<pedalboard-name>)
